### Danmarks Meteorologiske Institut 
#### Cover Letter: Remote sensing scientist with focus on climate applications
Hi, 

My name is Dahlia and I am recent graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the U.S. with a dual [bachelor of science](https://www.dahlia.is/static/assets/applying/diploma.pdf#navpanes=0) in physics and electrical engineering. I am applying for this role because I am passionate about researching ways to develop and improve environmental monitoring architectures, and I believe that I possess the skillset to learn quickly and excel in this position. I moved to Copenhagen in September 2023 to begin an [internship](https://www.dahlia.is/working/at-tegnology) at [TEGnology Aps](https://www.tegnology.dk), where I am currently working. My internship term will be complete at the end of this year, so I am seeking full time employment beginning January 1, 2024. I plan to continue living in Copenhagen for the forseeable future, so the 3 year length of this position is particularly appealing to me because I would like to pursue higher education in Denmark and need to be working continuously here for 3 years in order to be eligible for S.U. 

I recognize that I may have less academic qualifications than your average applicant, but I believe that my extensive research experience in relevant subject areas has prepared me well to succeed in this role. In my current position at TEGnology, I am working on an ongoing EU collaboration called the [MISO project](https://miso.nilu.no/) which is a research mission to establish an autonomous in-situ observation platform for use in the Arctic to measure carbon dioxide and methane gasses. In this capacity, I have been performing several preliminary analyses of climate data to determine the feasiblity and technical constraints for adapting our thermoelectric energy harvesters to power sensors using the temperature difference between the soil and the surrounding air. One such preliminary analysis can be found at this deepnote notebook [here](https://deepnote.com/publish/MISO-bba04eb4-e2f5-4488-848b-a266b3ef1f3e). 

I also have done extensive literature review on remote sensing for water monitoring through my work on [swept source raman spectroscopy](https://www.dahlia.is/researching/sweptsourceraman-at-rle) at MIT, which was [featured](https://impactclimate.mit.edu/2023/09/27/student-spotlight-mcsc-scholar-dahlia-dry/) on MIT's Climate and Sustainability Consortium news page. Through my coursework in electrical engineering, I have developed a solid technical background in remote sensing systems, and my coursework in physics has prepared me well to conceptualize complex climate processes by analyzing them as the sum of their fundamental driving forces. I am currently involved in two active research publication drafts, so I am familiar with the publication pipeline and am proficient in software tools like LaTeX/Overleaf which are commonly used to collaboratively produce professional scientific writing. For an example of my past writing/research involving remote sensing, you are welcome to peruse my review article on emerging technologies for addressing the water data gap [here](https://www.dahlia.is/static/assets/rle/water_data_gap-mini_review.pdf)(this article is currently unpublished and is instead being incorporated into a larger research paper aimed for publication in 2024).

While my academic studies focused more on hardware and theory, my practical and research experience has been much more centered around data analysis and software development in python. I coded this website from scratch using the django python framework as a fun side project, and I place a special emphasis in my data visualization work on making analysis tools that are both *interactive* and *accessible*. This means leveraging lightweight webhosting frameworks like Deepnote and Heroku to enable easy link sharing, and dynamically packaging data products in graphical user interfaces using tools like Plotly-Dash so that they can be interacted with easily by others without needing to run or understand code. I also have substantial experience in database management with MySQL and cloud frameworks like AWS through my work at TEGnology and as a the [lead data analyst](https://www.dahlia.is/working/on-data-tools-for-tx31) on a congressional campaign in the U.S. 

Looking at my resumé you’ll find a large breadth of experience, but my substantial background in astrophysics and my current work on sensing technologies and energy harvesting are unified by my love of instrumentation. I am deeply motivated to pursue work in remote sensing because I am convinced that the deevelopment of deeper data architectures is critical to the successful deployment of the data-informed solutions that will be the bedrock upon which we build a sustainable future. In joining the team at DMI, I would bring this enthusiasm in addition to my broad technical proficiency in data analysis and my knack for learning quickly on the job. Thanks so much for your consideration and I hope to continue this conversation soon!

Best,
Dahlia
