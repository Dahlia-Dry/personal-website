Since Fall 2021, I have been collaborating on a project at MIT's Research Lab of Electronics that involves the use of a novel implementation of raman spectroscopy for monitoring of a variety of water-based analytes. I received funding an support for working on this project as part of the inaugural cohort of the [MIT Climate and Sustainability Scholars](https://news.mit.edu/2023/exploring-new-sides-climate-sustainability-research-0421). My work on this project was [featured](https://impactclimate.mit.edu/2023/09/27/student-spotlight-mcsc-scholar-dahlia-dry/ ) on the MIT Climate and Sustainability Consortium's news page. As part of my final deliverables for the climate scholars program, I recorded a 5 minute summary of my research intended for general audiences which you can watch here:

My main contribution to the project is a Dash-based control software which can be used to program and execute a variety of measurements by coordinating between our disparate hardware components to form one unified system. This software also features an analysis module which allows us to quickly and conveniently analyze our collected spectra.Â Although I am no longer at MIT, I am continuing to collaborate remotely on a research paper intended for publication in the coming year.
