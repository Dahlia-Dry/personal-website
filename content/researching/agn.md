During the summer of 2022, I received funding throgh MIT's [MISTI](https://misti.mit.edu/) program to live in Santiago, Chile and complete an academic research internship Universidad Diego Portales. Under the primary supervision of UDP postdoc Alejandra Rojas, I learned how to process and analyze [ALMA](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/) data using the [CASA](https://casa.nrao.edu/) software package with python. I am continuing to collaborate remotely with Dr. Rojas and STSci fellow Darshan Kakkad on a research paper analyzing the batch of ALMA data I have been working to process, discussing the role of molecular gas outflows in the formation of Active Galactic Nuclei.
