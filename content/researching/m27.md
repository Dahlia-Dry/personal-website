In Fall 2022, I took the physics capstone class 8.287 : Observational Techniques of Optical Astronomy. This class centered around an invidual astronomy research project conducted at MIT's [Wallace Observatory](https://web.mit.edu/wallace/). For my project, I chose to do optical spectroscopy of the Dumbbell Nebula because I have a strong technical interest in spectroscopic instrumentation. The dumbbell nebula also happens to be my [favorite nebula](https://www.dahlia.is/lost-in-space#&gid=1&pid=11), so I was very excited for the chance to image it using a far bigger telescope than I had ever had access to before. Below you will find my final project presentation slides and my final project report.
