During the summer of 2020, I worked with Prof. Amanda Bosh in the MIT Planetary Astronomy Lab on modeling the point spread functions of kuiper belt objects. I presented my work at an undergraduate student research symposium at the end of the summer, and my code for the project can be found on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/Dahlia-Dry/UROP-Summer-2020).
