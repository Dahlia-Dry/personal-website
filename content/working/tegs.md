In September of 2023, I moved to Copenhagen, Denmark to begin an internship at [TEGnology Aps](www.tegnology.dk) with funding from MIT's [MISTI](https://misti.mit.edu/) program. While here, I have been working on several IoT-related projects including the building of this [autonomous building sensing data dashboard](https://tegnology-smartbuilding-demo-68818149e9ed.herokuapp.com/) involving integrations with LoRAWAN protocols and Amazon Web Services. I have also been working on an ongoing EU collaboration called the [MISO project](https://miso.nilu.no/), which is a research mission to establish an autonomous in-situ observation platform for use in hard-to-reach areas (Arctic, wetlands) for detecting and quantifying carbon dioxide and methane gasses.
