## welcome to my collection of foldy adventures :) 
!text+gallery
I first learned about Bromptons from a youtube video of a guy who biked the entire [Carretera Austral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29a2hi961ko) on one and was instantly drawn to these weird little marvels of human engineering. The idea of owning one lived rent-free in my head over many moons and many paystubs; I kept tabs on the handful of stores in Florida that sold them, waiting for just the right one to pop up. And so, on one fateful afternoon in the depths of COVID lockdown, my sister and I masked up and drove three hours to Miami to meet the aggressively blue foldy bike that would become my perennial sidekick across three continents and many thousands of miles.

When lockdown finally ended and I flew back to Boston for university with my Brompton as my carry-on, I soon found myself biking with more and more with communities of serious cyclists who welcomed me and my deep love for this silly little bike with open arms ... and only the slightest bit of concern that those tiny wheels wouldn't hold up over so many miles. But after initially sharing that fear myself, I soon learned that the goofy appearance is deceiving; I was plenty capable of keeping up with my road bike friends on my tiny wheels. And because I was able to take my bike *everywhere* with me, from train to plane to bus to metro and every store and café along the way, I often had a neat little loophole out of many of the logistical headaches involved in bikepacking adventures. From [Bostreál](on-a-bike/bostreal) to the [Boston Triathlon](on-a-bike/boston-triathlon) and probably many a [winding switchback](on-a-bike/santiago-valparaiso-century) in the Chilean Andes or [muddy path](on-a-bike/tour-de-trolls-sjaelland) through Scandinavian forests, I've taken my foldy bike where few if any have been delusional? stubborn? deeply unserious? enough to take a foldy bike before and have found great happiness in showing that it's not only possible, but in some ways even practical.

A friend once sent me this lovely doodle to the right from a [post](https://www.wired.com/story/north-london-dirt-brompton-t-line-folding-commuter-bike/) by a kindred foldy bike enthusiast; I feel like it really captures the charm of these silly little bikes. This isn't a Brompton sales pitch, just a love letter of sorts to a trusty travel companion that will always hold a special place in my heart :)
