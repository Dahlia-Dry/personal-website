Ever since I started getting serious about biking, I have been converting my Brompton bit by bit into more and more of a proper road bike. The first set of modifications I made was switching my stock 50T chainring to the bigger 56T version and my tires to the thin and grippy Schwalbe One's to enable a much speedier ride at the [Boston Triathlon](boston-tri). Then came changing out the stock handlebars for [small bullhorn grips](https://www.ergonbike.com/en/product-details.html?a=griffe&s=gptouring&anr=42410036), which were *much* more comfortable for longer rides as I started training for [Bostre√°l](bostreal). 

But the deeper I got into bike world, the more I yearned for proper road bike handlebars, even though I felt like me and my foldy bike were still perfectly capable of keeping up with my road bike friends on long journeys. I also most definitely was not living a life where owning multiple bikes was feasible, and I greatly enjoyed the additional freedom I had to bring my bike places a normal bike wouldn't fit. 

I first discovered the potential to make this vague ambition into a reality after a chance encounter with the owner of this [very awesome Brompton](mybikesite.org). I spent several months pondering if it was worth the parts investment and the risk of it not working out, but in May of 2023 I graduated from university and had one last blissfully chill summer to spend in Boston before moving to Copenhagen at the end of August, so I decided if I was gonna give it a go it was now or never. The skeptics told me it was a frivolous and needlessly difficult endeavor - at that point, why not just get a real road bike?? My reasons for adamantly insisting the Brompton can do it all I talk about [in this post](). But for why *drop bars* specifically, here's my reasons, in order of importance:

1. **Increased Comfort on Long Rides**  
2. **More Reliable Shifting** 
3. **A Little Speedier, Of Course** 

So with the commitment settled, I drew heavy inspiration from the aforementioned [mybikesite.org](mybikesite.org) to come up with my plan and my parts list. In case you're reading this post and find my pitch compelling, I'll try to describe the process as completely as possible for replication purposes. The parts are as follows:

- **Dahon D4D Stem** (by far the most difficult to source. I think I ended up getting mine from AliExpress but it took forever to come and I had to try multiple different sellers)
- **25.4mm diameter x 420mm length Drop Handlebar**
- **Pair of 25.4 - 31.8mm Handlebar Shims**
- **Sunrace SLM96 Friction Shifter** (For the 2 external gears)
- **Sturmey-Archer SLS30 Thumb Shifter** (for the SA hub)
- **Pair of generic aero brake levers without shifters**
- **Some spare 25.4mm diameter aluminum rod** (I used an old seatpost I found lying around)
