Ever since I started getting serious about biking, I have been converting my Brompton bit by bit into more and more of a proper road bike (much to the amusement of my bike friends who continuously wonder why I don't just, you know, acquire a proper road bike). The first set of modifications I made was switching my stock 50T chainring to the bigger 56T version and my tires to the thin and grippy Schwalbe One's to enable a much speedier ride at the [Boston Triathlon](boston-tri). Then came changing out the stock handlebars for [small bullhorn grips](https://www.ergonbike.com/en/product-details.html?a=griffe&s=gptouring&anr=42410036), which were *much* more comfortable for longer rides as I started training for [BostreÃ¡l](bostreal). Then I eventually swapped out my homemade velctro foot straps for proper clipless pedals.

But the deeper I got into bike world, the more I yearned for proper road bike handlebars, even though I felt like me and my foldy bike were still perfectly capable of keeping up with my road bike friends on long journeys. I knew the better ergonomics of drop bars would do wonders for my soreness on long rides but I most definitely was not living a life where owning multiple bikes was feasible, financially or logistically. I also greatly enjoyed the additional freedom I had to bring my bike places a normal bike wouldn't fit, so I wondered if it were possible to have my cake and eat it too by making the dream of a foldy road bike into reality.

I first discovered this could indeed be done after a chance encounter with the owner of this [very awesome Brompton](mybikesite.org). I spent several months pondering if it was worth the parts investment and the risk of it not working out, but in May of 2023 I graduated from university and had one last blissfully chill summer to spend in Boston before moving to Copenhagen at the end of August, so I decided if I was gonna give it a go it was now or never. As to why *drop bars* specifically, here's my reasons, in order of importance:

##### 1. **Increased Comfort on Long Rides**
!text+img
With the stock Brompton handlebars, you have approximately one riding position. With drop bars, there's something like 5 (image from [this article](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/This-image-presents-the-five-possible-hand-positions-on-a-drop-bar-tops-hoods-ramps_fig2_344258180)). For long rides, all that time in one position _really_ adds up in the shoulders and the neck and the back and the wrists. With the mini bullhorn grips modification I was able to have more like two riding positions which was already a huge improvement for my wrists, but that was small change compared to how nice it would be to have more variation in my back posture and neck as well.

##### 2. **More Reliable Shifting** 
For a bike made in a place as rainy as the UK, I've gotta say the performance of the Brompton shifters in wet conditions is pretty disappointing. Any ride over 40 miles in the rain, I could count on decent odds of eventually being stuck with only 3 or 2 or sometimes even 1 gear because the shifters get gummed up. Switching to friction shifters solves the unreliability problem of indexed shifters; way less moving parts, way less chance for things to go wrong. 
##### 3. **Cool Factor** 
Finally, of course, drop bars are more aero and they just look cool ðŸ˜Ž I doubt there's much speed improvement just from aerodynamics since I'm not able to get too aggressive of a drop without having the bars too close to the seatpost, but I do feel a noticeable difference in how much power I can output with the better riding posture.

##### The Process
So with the commitment settled, I drew heavy inspiration from the aforementioned [mybikesite.org](mybikesite.org) to come up with my plan and my parts list. In case you're reading this post and find my pitch compelling, I'll try to describe the process as completely as possible for replication purposes. The parts are as follows:

- **Dahon D4D Stem** (by far the most difficult to source. I think I ended up getting mine from AliExpress but it took forever to come and I had to try multiple different sellers)
- **25.4mm diameter x 420mm length Drop Handlebar**
- **2 Pair of 25.4 - 31.8mm Handlebar Shims**
- **Sunrace SLM96 Friction Shifter** (For the 2 external gears)
- **Sturmey-Archer SLS30 Thumb Shifter** (for the SA hub)
- **Pair of generic aero brake levers without shifters**
- **Some spare 25.4mm diameter aluminum rod** (I used an old seatpost I found lying around)
- **bar tape** (bonus points for fun color)

First I loosened the stem bolt, handlebar grips, and brakes/shifters and removed the old handlebar. Then, I cut a short length of the 25.4mm aluminum rod and slid it into the stem holder. On each end I superglued one of the 25.4-31.8mm shims. I know, I know, using _glue_ on something like this sounds like an awful idea, but I truly couldn't think of a better way to get them to stay in place and I knew the tension on the Dahon D4D Stem would properly hold them in place once it was attached so it's not like the glue would end up being a critical load bearing component or anything. 

Then I attached the Dahon D4D stem, which uses a clamp mechanism as a quick-release to adjust the handlebar position. The drop bars slide into the other end of the stem with another set of shims (also affixed using the questionable glue method and later with some electrical tape, shhhh it's fine). The trick is getting the tension on the clamp tight enough that the handlebars stay in place when you're riding, but still loose enough that you can open and close the clamp to fold the bike without too much difficulty. Definitely not as elegant as the original Brompton fold, but to me the extra few seconds of folding time is a worthwhile sacrifice. It doesn't even increase the folded dimensions by that much, which is super cool! 

After testing that the fold still works, I began the daunting task of rewiring the brake and shifter cables. The hardest bit was cutting everything to the right lengths and making sure the new setup didn't compromise the fold; I recommend starting with longer lengths and trimming as needed only after attempting to fold the bike completely with each new cable wired up. Hooking up the new internal shifter was thankfully easy since it's also made for Sturmey Archer 3 speed hubs. It was, however, necessary to adjust the limit screws on the 2 speed derailleur to get a good setup with the friction shifter. Eventually, though, it all came together, and as a reward I got to learn how to tape up drop bars for the first time. By serendipity the nearest bike shop just so happened to have bar tape in a color delightfully close to foldy bike blue, so of course I went with that option.

So yeah, that's pretty much all there was to it! On the eve of my departure to Copenhagen, I went on one last ride along the Charles River testing my new creation. I liked the idea of me and my trusty travel companion beginning a new chapter in life together, in different ways. There would be many more hours of fine tuning and adjustments to come in Copenhagen, using several months of my 20 mile daily work commute as a solid testing grounds before trying any long rides, but ultimately this setup has proven time and again to hold up well over the distance. Every time I set out on a new bike adventure these days, I'm very happy I decided to take the risk on this wacky little project :)
