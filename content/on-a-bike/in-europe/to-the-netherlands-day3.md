Unfortunately, my gamble on leaving my clothes outside overnight to dry did not pay off as I woke up to unforecasted rain in the morning. I was a bit slower to get going due to being thoroughly grossed out by everything being wet, but still managed to leave a little after 8am. So the morning was not off to the best start, but thankfully the rain let up soon after I left and things dry quick on a bike so it only took about an hour before I was feeling good again, as well as relieved that my body didn't feel too broken yet. I learned early on that I would be counting windmills all day. Very fun. I almost missed the first one I passed before making a sharp U-turn to go back and grab a photo with it.

The morning passed by pretty quick, with me feeling very grateful for the relative lack of headwind compared to yesterday and for the complete and total lack of any hills whatsoever. The roads were beautiful and delightfully smooth and passed through many canals and flower-dotted fields.

As soon as it was morning east coast time I called with some people to break up the loops of my thoughts a bit as the afternoon slid by. It was fun to show them bits and pieces of the incredible bike infrastructure I was encountering on my way, from the neatly numbered bike route system to the massive rows of bike parking near train stations to the bike highways snaking along next to the actual highways.

More interesting sights included some more windmills and a goat playground (yes, you read that right)!

Then the route took me through a nature preserve, which was very pretty and had some teeny tiny hills to switch things up a bit.

After a long and slightly tedious stretch of straight road with lots of other bike traffic, the trees gave way to farmland and I was alone again. Normally I don't like straight lines so much, but the symmetry of fields and the bike path and the horizon was very satisfying.

I love the Netherlands, I really do, but my one beef with this country based on my experience biking through it so far is that the gas stations are so very disappointing. Every time I'd pass one hoping I had finally found my next snack/drink stop, it ended up being a place that _just_ sells gas, and maybe car parts. Maybe my one car-brained conviction is that gas stations should always be snack meccas. So alas, I settled for deviating from my route a little bit to find the closest grocery store. I had the fun idea to pick up some stroopwafels as a camp dessert for the night instead of the usual marshmallows, in addition to another liter of water and some dried mangoes and powerade for road fuel. 

As I was packing my groceries before setting off again, a woman approached me and started asking me about my bike in Dutch. Even though I told her I only spoke een beetje Nederlands, she either didn't know much English or maybe just decided to be patient with me because she continued on speaking veel Nederlands to me anyway. I told her about my journey in stumbling Dutch that occasionally lapsed into Danish, trying not to let my nerves get the best of me in my excitement at the chance to practice my new language with a stranger. She was very kind and peppered me with lots of "wat leuk!" and wished me luck on my travels after a long anecdote about wishing her kids would bike more with her; truly a highlight of my day :)

After that the next ten miles flew by I was treated to a lovely stretch of sunshine and canals and bridges with plentiful tree cover for breaks from the heat.

Closing in on the last ten miles of the day, I was treated to a top-tier bridge overlook of the city of Deventer. Oh, and another windmill! I was calling with my friend Alex at the time and was thoroughly entertained listening to her on the other end of the phone getting into a conversation with a random person she had encountered on the street.

Of course, no bike day would be complete without at least a little hiccup of some kind, and so it was that I ended up having quite the time finding my way to my third and final camping spot in Klarenbeek. Around 2 miles from the destination, I ended up at a dead end where the road on my route was completely closed off, so I had to use google maps on my phone to find an alternate way that added a couple more miles. That was fine since I wasn't feeling too tired yet. The real challenge started once I arrived at the end point of the route, squinting at the pdf map I had been sent on my phone to try to determine whether the entrance was to the left or to the right of the given address number. I tentatively went for the left at first, venturing nervously past a sign that said "private property" and looking back and forth between the diagram on my phone and the farm buildings to my left trying to make the shapes match up. Eventually I reached the end of the long driveway, which was a dead end with an electric fence holding some cows who seemed bemused by my presence. After a couple more minutes of pondering the diagram, I realized I should have taken the entrance to the right and was instead in that moment definitely trespassing on some random stranger's property. I frantically backtracked, praying that nobody was home and feeling very grateful that I wasn't on some random farm in the U.S. where it could easily have been a _much_ more dangerous situation. 

Once back on the main road I found the hidden gate to the right and followed the diagram on an adventure through some forest before emerging onto a picturesque clearing with a beautiful old tower and some lawn chairs and a cute sign welcoming 1nitetent visitors. There was even a composting toilet, what luxury! Once I got over my relief at finally finding the spot, I collapsed in one of the chairs and relished in the feeling of knowing I would almost certainly finish this entire journey as planned. All three of the campsites reached, over 300 miles traveled, just a short half day ride the next morning to finish it off. That realization felt really, really good. Maybe even better than dinner and a stroopwafel warmed over the camp stove, or perhaps a close second.
