Recently I was windowshopping at a map store that caught my eye while I was biking in Copenhagen and picked up a very exciting book from the clearance rack called "Cykelture i Danmark". I was already feeling like I needed a treat-myself day, so I decided to go ahead and buy it. I brought it home and cooked some delectable peanut butter ramen and took the dinner and the book with me to our balcony so I could peruse it while sipping a nice cold drink and basking in the evening sun. A fantastic treat myself evening indeed. It didn't take me long to decide I wanted to pick a route from the book to do the coming weekend. Hence, to the fjord!

I decided to pack up my bike and leave for the fjord straight from work on a Friday afternoon, an interesting idea made possible by the beautiful intersection of the Danish workday tending to wind down at a sweet, sweet 3pm and these amazingly long days we have now in the peak of summer. Work was also giving out free beers that day just because, so I added one to my pack to slosh around for 50 some odd miles so that I could have a nice refreshment at the campsite :) 

I spent the workday staring apprehensively out the window at the on and off rainshowers and checking the radar before heading out at around 3pm, hoping for the best while also accepting that at some point I would almost certainly get a little wet. It only took about 20 minutes after leaving for that to end up being the case, and I was soon properly soaked and wondering whether it really was just rain or turning into hail from the way it stung against my skin. But I could literally see the clear sky just ahead of me so I pushed onwards and eventually made it back into the sun where I was able to dry off in no time. The rain coincided with the less pleasant biking out of the suburbs where I work, and by the time the sun came out again I was biking through beautiful fields peppered with wildflowers. I don't know exactly what kind of grass it was, maybe some kind of wheat, but it was _so_ soft and fluffy and absolutely mesmerizing to watch rippling gently in the wind:

A bit further along I turned onto a bike route called "panoramavej" whose name did not disappoint. I passed through more picturesque fields with glimpses of coastline in the distance and admired the clouds while also bracing mentally for the likelihood of more rain as they grew angrier and angrier looking.

Aaaaand just like that I was completely soaked again ... captured a lovely before and after roughly 20 minutes apart:

Then for the next 7 miles or so I was pretty solidly not having a great time. I was biking into a headwind, getting pelted by rain, and had turned onto a more boring straight road next to cars with a mild but seemingly endless uphill grade. A couple times it seemed like the rain was juuuust about to stop, only for it to pick up again with even greater intensity than before. But eventually I could see the sky start to lighten ahead, and sure enough I got through the last of the rain just as I reached a bridge that began one of the most picturesque stretches of the whole ride.

And from there I felt like I was passing through scene after scene from out of a postcard. I had also told various people I'd be on my bike for the whole afternoon so they could call me at any point if they wanted, and I really enjoyed interspersing the time alone with my own thoughts with the chance to catch up with people I care about and let them know I appreciate them :) It was so fun to show each of them a bit of my surroundings which varied widely between calls, from forest to harbor to field to fjord.

Eventually around 8pm I reached the campsite feeling so happy I could have kept biking for days. It was truly an incredible afternoon; if anything the rain just made the sun afterwards that much more enjoyable. I took my time setting up tent and cooking dinner and writing a bit before cracking open my work beer to celebrate a successful friday adventure. I got warm and cozy in my sleeping bag, watched an incredible sunset over the hills, and roasted a few marshmallows before settling in for the night, already excited to get going again saturday.

# Day 2 Part 1: To the Ferry

I wasn't in any rush to leave the next morning since I was only planning for a half-day of biking, so it was by sheer luck that I managed to pack up and break camp juuust before getting hit with the rain. It was just a bit of a sprinkle at first and the scenery was lovely so my spirits weren't dampened too much even as my clothes slowly began to saturate with water.

After cruising along the fjord coastline for a bit I passed through a lovely stretch of forest on a separated bikelane that was flat and fast. There were also plenty of very hyggeligt looking summer houses, and I imagined how lively they'd be later in the day assuming the sun ever decided to come out.

Eventually I made it to the small town of Rørvig, where I was able to escape from the rain for a bit in the ferry waiting room. I got a ticket for the next boat to Hundested leaving in twenty minutes and realized how soaking wet I had become when I had to hold the flimsy paper ticket gingerly by the top edge to avoid turning it into pulp. My second realization was that I had actually become rather cold, and I was very thankful to have half an hour on the ferry to warm up a bit before heading back out into the rain again.

# Day 2 Part 2: Coast to Castle

The radar said that the rain would pass, eventually. Key word, eventually. As the ferry approached Hundested, I stepped back outside again to stand by my bike and found that it was in fact raining worse on this side of the fjord. I disembarked from the ferry, loaded the next part of my route, and contemplated finding a place to grab a coffee and wait it out as several other people in the harbor seemed to be doing. But I decided since I was already well and truly soaked again in the five minutes I had been outside so far, I might as well just keep going and pray for the sun to come soon.

Alas, it didn't come _soon_, per se. Patience is a virtue. I tried to think happy thoughts, like "hey, nice view!", and "later I will eat ice cream under a blue sky" and "well, at least I don't have to put on sunscreen yet!". I passed a christmas tree farm with some cool little bird-kite looking things.

And, sure enough, the rain didn't last forever. The clouds began to clear just as I got to the top of a hill with a stunning view -- a wide open field carpeted with wildflowers, swaying gently in the wind as sunbeams began to peek through the gray sky.
!figs roskilde-fjord/day2-12.JPG roskilde-fjord/day2-13.JPG --nocaption --notitle
The weather only got better from there. After a little ways further the route joined up with the northern coastline of Sjælland, beginning a second half of the day filled with sunshine and beaches and gentle breeze; before I knew it I was dry again and the cold, wet morning felt like a distant memory.

There were much more off-road sections than I usually prefer, but when I was planning the route I decided it would be worth it to slug through some extra trail for the beach views I'd get by sticking to the coastline. This definitely ended up being the case, but there were some interesting, more ~technical~ sections and occasional brief hikes that at times especially with all the extra weight on my bike made me wish I were cruising on some asphalt instead. All worth it for the adventure though of course :)

And the views.... I'll just let the pictures speak for themselves... To say the least, the rainy morning it took to get here was _so_, so worth it.

I passed through so many cute little beach towns with an endless bounty of ice cream spots tempting me to stop for a little treat, and if I had been biking with a friend I know for sure we would have stopped for _at least_ one. But I find when I'm riding solo I don't really like stopping for too long at any one place, especially for food or drinks. I much prefer to snack on the bike and then have the real food taste sooo much better at the end of the ride. So I kept circulating that happy thought about ice cream under a blue sky but promising myself it'd taste sooo much better knowing I was only a five minute bike from the train home. And indeed, after meandering my way along hours of pristine beach trails in no particular rush but starting to feel myself crashing a bit, I spotted the familiar outline of Kronborg castle in the distance and immediately was filled with a second wind. I pushed the pace for the last 5 or so miles and beelined for the first ice cream spot I could find in Elsinore. Just as I had been picturing all day, I got a mango sorbet and found a picnic bench and basked in the satisfcation of making my dream into a reality. A positively sublime way to finish up the day.

And then, after taking a moment to admire the castle views, getting back home to Copenhagen was blissfully easy. I waited just a few minutes before I was able to hop on the next train with ample space to store my bike and stare out the windows and enjoy the views... just Denmark things :)
