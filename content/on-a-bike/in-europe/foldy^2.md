## Day 1

On Thursday my friend Max decided to swing by on the latest stop in his european train journey and with a very exciting surprise -- he acquired a Brompton in London! So naturally, we planned a fun little impromptu foldy adventure for the weekend. We set off from Copenhagen quite late in the day Saturday with not much of a plan in mind besides a [free shelter](udinaturen.dk/shelter/5861?scExtIds=1150,1303,6586&adScIds=&from=map) picked out to camp at. Since we didn't end up heading out until close to 5pm, we decided to take the S train out to Frederikssund and bike a short 10-ish miles from there. On the train we found out that we both have the same watch face! Very fun.

Instead of biking up the closer side of the fjord (boring), we decided to do the more fun but slightly longer route where you cross a bridge and then take a ferry from the tip of the fjord in Kulhuse a short stretch north to Sølager. On the way to the bridge we saw some fun Waldos and a very america-core "route 66 U.S. burger cafe".

Max was navigating so we ended up pretty much entirely on gravel whereas I usually opt for asphalt. It was slower going but there were gorgeous views, and we weren't in any rush. Or, at least, we didn't think we needed to be.

We stopped for a snack next to a gorgeous sunflower field right by the water and I realized that maybe it would be a good idea to check if the ferry was actually running before biking all the way up the fjord with no other means of getting to the other side except going all the way back the way we came. The website was sparse and there was no answer when I tried calling the reception, but the timetable said the last ferry was supposed to depart at 19:45. It was at this point that we realized that oops, we actually maybe should be in a bit of a rush! We had a little less than an hour to do 7 more miles, so still not _tooo_ much of a rush, but perhaps no more stops and detours.. at least until the other side of the fjord.

Of course, as soon as the universe heard that we had somewhere to be, it was time for me to get a flat tire. To be fair, this occurred following a particularly violent stretch of rocky gravel that we rattled through with reckless abandon. So in the midst of getting eaten alive by mosquitoes, I showed Max how to fix a rear flat on a Brompton while he generously helped with the most annoying part by inflating the new tube with the hand pump. That ate up around 15 minutes, so then by the time we got going again we were _actually_ in a rush.

There were only a few miles to go so we just pushed the pace and then had a bit of fun with a good sprint to the end. But despite cruising into the ferry port juuuust in time for the last scheduled departure at 7:45, we rolled up to an empty boat that very much did _not_ look to be leaving anytime soon. Upon asking around we learned that the ferry wasn't currently running due to the strong winds, and the guy selling ice cream gave us the most pitying look as he told us that the only way to the other side of the fjord was allll the way back down to where we had come from.

Thankfully we still had at least an hour or so of solid daylight left, so we could at the very least get back to the train before dark and decide from there if we wanted to go back to Copenhagen or continue the rest of the way to the campsite with headlamps and bike lights. Despite this second curveball of the evening, neither of us were too worried and didn't mind the extra distance especially going a speedier way back than we had come. Whereas we were on gravel most of the way up the fjord, on the way back down we took the asphalt route which featured some fantastic rolling hills and golden hour vistas. A fun additional silver lining was a quick stop to check out Jægerspris slot, so now both days of the trip would have a castle!

Eventually we made it back down to the bridge we had crossed at the beginning, and decided to commit to camping for the night instead of heading back to Copenhagen on the train. We made quick work up the other side of the fjord as the slow summer sunset finally faded to night.

It was well and truly dark by the time we got to the campsite around 10:30, and I was very much glad for not being alone as I was reminded of how trekking into the forest with a headlamp looks like b roll from the blair witch project. We ended up sharing the shelter area with a nice Polish family and enjoying a very late sodium bomb of a dinner (ramen and chips) which was delicious in the moment but sliiightly regrettable once I spent the night waking up periodically and gulping all the water I had left. I was already on a streak of short nights that week, so it was a good and deep tent sleep nonetheless.

## Day 2

We woke up to a gorgeous sunny morning with the shelter site transformed from a spooky dark wilderness to a vibrant sea of green. Both running on several nights of short sleep, we were in no particular rush to get going and took some time to bask in the slow morning. The wind through the trees was strong enough to sound almost like waves crashing against the shore, and we were very satisfied with our decision to plan a route with as much tailwind as possible.

Around 10am we decided to get going after a delicious breakfast of oatmeal and muesli with a nutella packet split between us courtesy of Max. There was a really neat bug on my handlebars who unfortunately decided not to tag along for the ride.

I let Max take over the navigation again in the morning, which meant more gravel. But it was really nice to explore some new paths since most of the rest of the ride for the day I'd already seen before! This gravel was also pretty tame, and the views were way better than they were on the road when I passed through this area previously.

Eventually we joined back up with my planned route and reached the familiar stretch up towards Gilleleje filled with picturesque ocean views. The waves were huge because of the wind! We briefly stopped by a yoga expo that piqued our curiosity.

We also stopped for a bit to watch some of the windsurfers, and we both definitely had fomo watching them carve beautifully along the waves; the wind was in the absolute perfect direction and it looked like a blast. Max half-jokingly suggested asking one of them if they'd let him go out and surf for a bit if he offered them 20 bucks for their board.

Ever the too-good-to-go evangelist, Max brought a giant bag of carrots that he got for a bargain as a bike snack. I originally was skeptical, but I like to think I can admit when I'm wrong and I must say after this trip I'm convinced - carrots really are a quality bike snack! Normally I'd think just plain carrots is too bland, and that's still true on a bike, but the crunch is really where it's at. So satisfying. Also not messy at all, and really easy to munch on while still being able to switch gears and stuff. Definitely not energy-dense enough to fuel a whole ride, but I did really appreciate the opportunity to snack on something fresh for a change! Noted for next time.

A little before Gilleleje we ran into an older couple from New York on foldy bikes and struck up a conversation with them for a bit - the woman had road bike handlebars on her Bike Friday! Apparently they'll make them for you that way if you ask. Only the second foldy bike I've ever seen in person (excluding my own) that has drop bars. Very cool.

The tailwind really made the back half of the ride so much nicer than the last time I had gone this route. We were just cruising along, barely needing to pedal, savoring the incredible beach views. In what felt like no time, we were in Elsinore, and there was the familiar outline of Kronborg castle! We ended the ride with a nice leisurely walk around the perimeter and, of course, some quality bike lean photo opportunities. With two bikes you don't even need to find something to lean them on, they can just support each other! Maybe there's a message there, hah.

In the grass on the other side of the castle we found a really cool giant map of Sjælland!

And finally, we made our way to the train station and grabbed a pint of ben and jerry's (a tad obscenely overpriced but worth it) at the 7-Eleven to enjoy on the ride back to Copenhagen. Quality way to top off the weekend.

## Epilogue

On Monday evening after I got off work we had time for one last foldy excursion before Max had to catch his red-eye train, so I took him on the good ol' tour de Amager to meet one of the trolls. We went to see Bjarke Cirkelsten and then went for a swim and Max found a miraculously unpicked bush of blackberries on the way back so we stopped for a fantastic snack break. Then after dinner and spending a while watching the perseids it was time for the foldy bikes to part ways - until the next adventure :)
