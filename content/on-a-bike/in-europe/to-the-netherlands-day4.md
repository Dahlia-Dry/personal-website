Unfortunately, even though the campsite was lovely, I ended up having one of the worst tent sleeps I've ever had. A little after midnight something outside started screeching so loudly it sounded like it was two inches away from my ear, and I could not for the _life_ of me figure out what kind of creature it was. I have attached audio for your consideration (if you know what it was, please do tell because I'm still curious!). I had to resort to putting in headphones to try to drown out the sound, which didn't help very much.

So after a night of very intermittent and shallow sleep I emerged from the tent feeling swollen, sore, dehydrated, tired, hungry, etc etc. But thankfully there was only a half day of riding left to go, and I felt better after some warm oatmeal for breakfast. I said goodbye to whatever creature was screaming at me all night and made my way back out through the forest before setting off just after 8 into a grey and foggy morning. It was supposed to get a lot warmer later, so I was happy to beat the heat for the first few hours of the day.

After about 10 miles I got my first proper hills in the Netherlands in an absolutely gorgeous national park. And despite all the extra weight and being on my fourth day of riding, I felt pretty good on the climbs! And the downhills were incredibly refreshing after so much flat. The roads were beautifully paved and I had them almost all to myself as I spent the next hour cruising through the forests.

Then I passed through the city of Arnhem, which provided the opportunity for a water stop and another nice bridge.

After Arnhem I ended up on a really cool bike highway that was pleasant in every way except the weather getting a little too hot. I saw my first sign pointing towards Nijmegen, which was very exciting. I also started seeing clues that I was approaching the 4daagse, with the orange and green flag appearing outside more and more buildings.

And then came the magical moment a little after 12pm where I saw my first familiar sight in over 330 miles: the bridge crossing the Waal river into Nijmegen. My favorite bridge of the whole trip and it's not even close. The banks of the river were decked out with colorful tents and it was clear that there was a massive party underway throughout the city. I spent a little while sipping some water and sending to updates to people that I had arrived and admiring the view before slowly making my way over the last bridge of my journey.

It was more than a little surreal to spend the last couple miles biking past places I'd seen before after four days of everything being new and unknown to me. I had been a bit nervous at the start of this trip that I would arrive too broken and tired to make the most of the visit, so I was thrilled and relieved with how good I felt; I was a little sore and sleep deprived but honestly I felt like I could have biked another century that day if I really had to. Upon arriving at my girlfriend's family's house I was treated to a refreshing shower and the lunch of my dreams (âœ¨breadâœ¨) before heading back out into the city with her brother to go meet her at the end of her third day of walking. What followed was a wonderful few days filled with lovely people and many moments that felt too good to be true. I could not have been prouder to see her walking down the Via Gladiola on the final stretch of the fourth day and I was so grateful I got to be there to see it.

## Epilogue 
I was told that the vierdaagse is like a utopia of sorts, and after witnessing it in person I understand that. It's a whole four days devoted to the indomitable will of the human spirit. The fact that everyone must walk is a great equalizer of sorts; regardless of how fit you are, it will take you a very long time and as a result it will challenge your body and your mind. There is no single "winner" and nobody keeps close track of the time; finishing is finishing, and that's all there is to it. Everyone helps each other and thousands of people gather on the sidelines and party for hours and cheer on the walkers. It's a little impossible not to be happy there. 

I think the experience of relying on nobody but myself for four days to get there made me appreciate the magic of the event even more. I've always felt much more comfortable with my lows being my burden to bear and mine alone, and I struggle with accepting help from others even when I really need it. And don't get me wrong, some of the most potent happiness I've ever felt has been while flying down a hill in the middle of nowhere with nobody but me and my bike.

But there's something beautiful and human in the best sense of the word about being vulnerable enough to lean on others through adversity and patient enough to show up for those you love. In standing outside for hours offering drinks and snacks and cold water sprays to strangers because you know they'll be thirsty and hungry and overheated. And in cheering and waving signs and dancing to music and allowing the joy of others to fill you up until you're overflowing with it, until you can't help but spread it further.
