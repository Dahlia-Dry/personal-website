## Ride 1
<iframe src="https://ridewithgps.com/embeds?type=trip&id=147912631&sampleGraph=true&showPhotos=true" style="padding:10px; width: 1px; min-width: 100%; height: 700px; border: none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>

This ride started with a very ambitious plan: 14 trolls, 103 miles. Alas, the trolls were better at hiding than I anticipated and I know enough about horror movies not to go searching for mystical beings in the scandinavian wilderness after dark, so I accepted 11 trolls as a consolation prize. Still not too shabby for one day! 

To be fair, this was my first century attempt in a while and my first properly long ride in Denmark, so there was perhaps a bit more delusional ambition than usual involved in my estimation of what's possible between a sunrise and a sunset. I also was dragging my feet a bit in the morning and left closer to 8 than to 7, so I already wasn't off to a great start time-wise. But the first troll on my route was only a short commute from our apartment in Amagerbro, and I wanted to make sure it was light enough for a picture! Because I've been approaching this as a scavenger hunt, the rule is pics or it didn't happen, of course.

So it was just shy of 8 when I found my first troll of the day, [Suldetrolden Sanka](https://trollmap.com/#/sanka-suttetrold). I would soon learn the trend of the day: the further out from copenhagen you get, the harder the trolls are to find. So this first one gave me a very false picture of how difficult this whole task would be. Probably for the best, I think a little naïve optimism is nice when it gets you to do things you'd know were perhaps too crazy to attempt otherwise.

The sunrise was rather gorgeous as I made my way along Kalvebod Fælled towards the southern end of Amager. After a bit of mild off-roading and backtracking (also something little did I know I'd be doing QUITE a lot of that day), I found the second troll of the day, [Bjarke Cirkelsten](https://trollmap.com/#/bjarkecirkelsten).

From there I looped around the coastline of Kalvebod Fælled and found troll #3, [Lange Liv](https://trollmap.com/#/liv) hanging out on a tiny island below the bridge between Amager and Sjælland.

Next on the route were, according to troll lore, the [six forgotten giants](https://trollmap.com/#/little-tilde-info). First was [Bakketop Trine](https://trollmap.com/#/hilltoptrine) and then [Sovende Louis](https://trollmap.com/#/sleepinglouis), both of whom were pretty easy to find. Also it was around this time that the sun won its battle with the clouds for the first day in *a while*, so between trollhunting and photosynthesizing I was having an excellent time.

The next forgotten giant, [Thomas på Bjerget](https://trollmap.com/#/thomasonthemountain), was, as the name suggests, a little harder to get to. I ended up doing a mini-hike with my bike on my shoulder climbing up to where he was hiding in the trees, but he was really cool (legs so long!!) so it was worth it. I made my way back to the bike path and crossed over a beautiful little bridge before doing another mini forest trek to [Lille Tilde](https://trollmap.com/#/littletilde). The rain from the night before was really proving to make the task of troll finding substantially harder, because bike shoes with neoprene thermal sleeves are already horrible hiking shoes and they are most definitely even worse when slogging through puddles and mud. But I wasn't about to let a little dirt stop me :)

The next troll was quite fun to find, and led me down a boardwalk to a gorgeous beach view! True to my not-super-observant tendencies, I initally passed right by [Oscar Under Broen](https://trollmap.com/#/oscarunderthebridge) before doing a confused double-back and laughing a bit at the sight of a very large hand from below clinging to the bridge I had just crossed. True to Danish charm, whimsical in the best way. It was around noon at this point and I was close enough to halfway, so I decided to enjoy a classic on-the-bike lunch (pretzels+protein bar) under the bridge with Oscar before setting off again.

The dirt may not have stopped me, but the water indeed did prove to be a nonnegotiable obstacle in getting a proper meeting with the last forgotten giant, [Teddy Venlig](https://trollmap.com/#/teddyfriendly). The whole area around him was completely flooded and I didn't particularly desire my toes to be any colder than they already were by getting them fully soaked, so I settled for a picture from afar.

The next part is where things properly started to get tricky. I spent at least an hour far from any proper bike path meandering through the forest looking for [Glade Anders](https://trollmap.com/#/gladeanders), and this is really where my toxic completionism got the best of me because did I eventually find him? Yes. Did I use up pretty much all the rest of my phone battery squinting at google maps to do so? Also yes. But before turning to that problem I took a moment to appreciate the troll and the silence and my irrational relief at not having to come all the way back here another day to look for him again.

This would have been less of a problem if by the time I found my way out of the forest I hadn't meandered so far off the route on my watch, but alas, it seemed I would have to guesstimate my way to Roskilde by following street signs and find somewhere selling portable chargers there. I would have been much more stressed in this situation if I were more challenged for daylight, but I knew I still had a solid couple hours and that Roskilde wasn't too too far. I did know that I needed my phone back though, because at this point it was clear that I was running far behind enough that I wouldn't come close to being able to complete the whole route before sunset and I needed to figure out a shorter way home. 

Thankfully, analogue navigation ended up being not too challenging and on the outskirts of Roskilde I was pretty quickly able to find an electronics store. So I folded up my bike and walked in with it, both me and bike solidly caked in mud at this point. I did my best to ignore the (reasonable) stares and grabbed the first portable charger I could find. Of course, as luck would have it, I happened to pick one that didn't come pre-charged even though the box said it did, so I had to swallow my embarrassment and walk *back* in with the box that I had just ripped up, pick out a different charger, and meekly ask the cashier for a return even though I had just told him I didn't need a receipt. Thankfully he didn't give me a hard time, and within 10 minutes my phone had juice again. 

I was feeling a bit defeated and tired after that whole ordeal I pondered just heading back at this point, but I had enough daylight left to go find one last troll so I decided to continue onwards past Roskile to [Runde Rie](https://trollmap.com/#/rie). Golden hour was just beginning to set in as I turned off the pavement and began yet another offroading adventure. This troll also proved to be quite good at hiding, and after concluding that google maps was no longer of much use had to do a good bit of backtracking and experimenting with different paths before I ventured a ways down a bend and turned a corner to find the large wooden fellow fishing at a tranquil lakeside overlook. The water was impossibly blue set against the rich gold of the sunstruck hills, and a thin sliver of moon presided over a cloudless sky. I took a good while to sit on the lap of my silent company and enjoy the view; it felt especially satisfying that the final troll of the day just so happened to be my favorite thus far.

I got a bit more lost on my way back to the main road by mistakenly thinking I could find a quicker way instead of just retracing my path and accidentally ended up in a full-on mountain bike course looking very, very dumb and lost with my tiny wheels. I heard cars and thought I could climb over a bank to get back onto the road, but it ended up being a highway so that was a no-go. I finally gave up and decided to just backtrack all the way and go back the way I had come; by the time I found pavement again the sun had just slipped below the horizon. Thankfully, navigation from Roskilde back to Copenhagen turned out to be exceedingly simple; there's just one long, straight road that took me all 25 or so miles back into the city without a single turn. I made pretty decent time and was surprised by how good I felt after not biking this far in a while. As the twilight faded to dark, I saw the stars for the first time in a while in these seldom-cloudless skies.

## Ride 2

It was a friday morning and my work permit was still lost somewhere in the labyrinth of danish bureaucracy, so I decided to go find some more trolls. First was an early visit to [Green George](https://trollmap.com/#/green-george), a friendly fixture of Christiania and the only troll I'd actually met already before starting this quest. 
!img tour-de-trolls-sjaelland/green-george.JPG --nocaption --notitle

Next I made my way to Nordhavn to find the last of the 3 trolls in Copenhagen proper, [Kaptajn Nalle](https://trollmap.com/#/kaptajn-nalle). I thought this would be fairly easy like the other two Copenhagen trolls but I was mistaken. There was a lot of construction happening in the area so my map led me to quite a few dead ends that I had to find detours around. Eventually I found the edge of the field where I was able to make out the troll silhouette from afar, but after making a full lap around the perimeter it seemed to be fenced in on all sides. At this point I considered giving up and trying again in warmer weather perhaps, but then I came across a segment of beat-down fence that definitely didn't look *officially* like an entrance but would work well enough. I was victim once again to rain the night before, so I ended up being unable to avoid squelching through thick mud and getting my feet fully soaked in cold water.

!text+img
But alas, I had already committed to the follow through at this point, so perhaps a bit unwisely I hoisted my bike over my shoulder and continued onwards. Eventually I reached a dry spot in the middle of the field where I was graced with the presence of the Nordhavn troll and his *very* beached boat. Worth it for the completionism but perhaps less worth it for the freezing cold toes I'd have for the rest of the day.

Next it was onwards 20 or so miles north to Halerød. I was up against some decently strong headwinds which was particularly brutal for my already wet and cold feet, but to the masochist in me it was a nice exercise to experiment with strategies for diverting my attention away from the pain knowing that it didn't represent any real danger (probably, right?). I tried not to picture dead toes and did a lot of bike karaoke. Otherwise the route was nice and I was looking forward to the reward of a fast ride with the wind on the way back. 

Just shy of 10am, I was thrilled to spot [Hanna Halerød](https://trollmap.com/#/hanna) tucked away in the forest just off the side of the small side road I'd been cruising down - no more getting lost for today! Although Kaptajn Nalle had been perhaps a little not worth the frozen toes, Hanna Halerød was *very* worth the visit. The sun was peeking through the clouds a bit and the day had warmed up enough for me to spend a tranquil hour or so with alone with the troll and my thoughts in the forest, snapping some photos and enjoying a midmorning snack and listening to the wind in the trees.

There was also a really cool stick fort nearby! Origin unknown; like a troll temple of sorts.

And so concluded Tour de Trolls Sjælland with a nice fast ride south back to Copenhagen, filled with the beginnings of plans for troll visits to come :)
