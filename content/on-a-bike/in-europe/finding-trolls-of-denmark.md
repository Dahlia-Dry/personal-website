Since moving to Denmark, I have fallen a bit in love with the Danish artist Thomas Dambo's [trolls](https://trollmap.com/#/@55.8393x12.3667z11.04). They have a certain energy about them. Maybe they have wisdom that could be useful to me. So, I've made it a little bit of a side quest to visit every single one in Denmark, one bike adventure at a time. As of April I have visited all the trolls in Sj√¶lland and Fyn, and all that remains is to make a pilgrimage or two to Jylland. I'm hoping to finish the quest sometime this summer - stay tuned!
