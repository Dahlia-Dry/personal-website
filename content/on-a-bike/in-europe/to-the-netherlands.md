Every year in the Netherlands there's a giant event called the [4daagse](https://www.4daagse.nl/en) where a whole lot of people walk 30, 40, or 50 kilometers each day for 4 days straight (and party during the nights, if you're _really_ crazy). It's the largest organized walking event in the world and it takes place in the city of Nijmegen, which also happens to be my girlfriend's hometown, so for the month of July she was back there spending some with her family and preparing to do the walk for her 3rd year (very cool!).

Naturally, I planned myself a fun little vacation to come support her on the walk and experience the magic of the event. We'd already flown to the Netherlands recently so I didn't want to add another two plane trips to my carbon footprint, and taking the train there is a long logistical nightmare. And, of course, I don't have a car let alone a drivers' license that's valid in Europe. So, I decided to get a little creative with my modes of transit and make the journey a bit more fun :)

On Sunday evening, after spending the whole day packing and having some of the worst "am I forgetting something" anxiety I've ever experienced, I left home and embarked upon the first leg of the journey - a very short ride to the Copenhagen airport, where I caught the next train heading across the Ã˜resund bridge to MalmÃ¶, Sweden (would have _loved_ to bike across the bridge, but alas, it's train/car only).

A little under an hour later, I exited MalmÃ¶ Central Station and made my way to the MalmÃ¶ Ferry Port, arriving just in time for check-in at 8pm. I got to chat a bit with a lovely Danish bikepacking family and two French bikepacking sisters towing 4 (2 each!) dogs in baby trailers before we were signaled ahead to start biking past the checkpoint and to the ferry loading dock. That was when I properly realized this is a wayyyyy bigger ferry than I have ever been on - a cruise ship basically!

I could hardly contain my excitement as I approached the massive open mouth of the ship, harbor in the background sparkling in the light of golden hour. My nerves started to ease up a bit; first step done! If all went according to plan this was going to be a _very_ fun trip :)

Once my bike was stowed, I had a quick, disappointing, and regrettably overpriced ferry buffet dinner (next time, remembering to bring my own food) before settling into my cozy little cabin to hopefully get the best sleep I'd be having for the next few days. It was indeed a pretty good sleep, if a bit cold. It was my first time ever sleeping on a boat, let alone being on a boat this huge. There were lots of interesting noises.
