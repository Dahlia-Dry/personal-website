One night in the summer of 2021 I was sitting in our kitchen with my friend and roommate at the time Grace, and offhandedly mentioned being interested in doing a triathlon at some point. One thing led to another, we fed each others' crazy a bit too much and signed up for the Boston triathlon... a couple months before it was supposed to happen, with approximately no plan. And I was going to do it on my foldy bike, naturally. 

Before we knew it the end of August rolled around and we took the T to Dorchester together to check in and drop our bikes off the evening before the race. The guy staffing the check in was very friendly but immediately clocked us for newbies, gave me and my bike the most skeptical once-over, and scared the shit out of us with stories about people having to drag themselves to the finish line because they're so destroyed by the end of the race. 

We both had rocks in our stomach that next early morning for sure. But it ended up being such a wonderful experience and an amazing introduction to triathlon - so, so fun. Me and Grace both swam fast, and I was feeling good going into the bike leg. I had made velcro straps for my pedals to "clip in" and get some extra zoom on my bike, and I was very happy with how speedy I felt during the ride. The course was four laps so there were crowds cheering the whole way, and people seemed to be really enjoying the silliness of my bike being in this race which was great for gassing me up. I made great time on the bike, exceeding my expectations, but I knew the run leg would be the worst for me by far. I indeed ended up slogging through the run, my legs feeling like jelly and recognizing many others in my division I'd passed on the bike leg overtaking me. At one point I passed someone who already had her finisher medal cheering from the sidelines and I asked her if I was close yet and she gave me the most apologetic look and said "not really", which was obviously not what I wanted to hear but helped me laugh a bit through the pain. It hurt but I knew that I would finish and that was all I needed to push through mentally, and I ended up finishing in 2:56, 4 minutes faster than my 3 hour goal. It was a great day indeed, and fun to prove a foldy bike can be pretty speedy if it needs to be :)
