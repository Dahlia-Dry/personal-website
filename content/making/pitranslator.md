During COVID I was bored and I wanted to learn how e-ink works so I thought hey what if I put quizlet in a cardboard box, and this little [project](https://github.com/Dahlia-Dry/PiTranslator/tree/master) was born. The idea was deeply unserious and just a little pointless, so in other words perfect fodder for a fun little project. I even got this tiny little bluetooth keyboard to connect to the Pi so I could type wirelessly and paired it with a mini portable charger so the box is entirely self-contained - neato. I brought this on a road trip and added words to study while reading Las Veinas Abiertas de Latinoamerica; fun was had, words were learned. Mission accomplished.
