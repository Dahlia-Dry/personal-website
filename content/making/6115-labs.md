The first time I really properly felt like an engineer was while I was toiling away for 20+ hours a week on a very notorious class at MIT called 6.115: Microcontroller Project Lab. It often devoured my evenings and weekends with a cruel, relentless indifference, yet I couldn't help but love it. Each student in this class is issued a very bulky secret-agent-looking black briefcase containing a custom-built Intel 8051 microcontroller that we program using Assembly on some very old windows machines. Below is a gallery of some of the cool things I built in this class during my very hectic final semester.
