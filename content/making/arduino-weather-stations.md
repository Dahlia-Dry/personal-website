Towards the end of my junior year of high school, I was a keynote speaker at the Florida State Science Fair Opening Ceremonies and gave a sort of irreverent [speech](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1761627887234024) titled “Math: The Story of an Unrequited Love”. Long story short, it was about how learning to code helped me discover my own way to explore the universe despite the fact that I love math, but it doesn’t always seem to love me back. One of the people in the audience saw that speech and got in contact with me, asking if I would host a workshop for an organization she was starting called the STEMinist Movement, which would seek to help middle school girls discover the joys of science the same way I did. 

Fast forward a few months, and the STEMinist Movement was on its feet. I was set to host the September set of workshops, and I knew I wanted to give the kids a hands-on introduction to computer science that would leave them excited to explore more. So, I set to work engineering the [“Hello World of Hardware”](https://github.com/Dahlia-Dry/STEMinist-Movement-2018/tree/master): a tiny weather station, contained within a half-size breadboard, upgradable, equipped with fun add-on projects, and composed of parts all costing under $15, so that we could offer the workshops free to all who wished to attend.

My goal with this little weather station was to create an introductory electronics project that is both accessible and FUN, two adjectives which in my mind aptly describe the Maker community that has fostered in me a passion for tinkering and asking “why not?”. I ended up hosting three workshops for at kids aged 7-15, two with the STEMinist Movement and one with the I Will Mentorship Foundation, where we built over 40 weather stations together and had quite a lot of fun in the process. Everything about this project, from the lengthy instruction manual to the add-on projects to the GitHub full of more things to do, is meant to encourage kids to not stop at the workshop, but to go forth on their own and explore a world of opportunity.
