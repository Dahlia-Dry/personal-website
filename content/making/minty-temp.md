A friend roped me into doing Science Olympiad so I built this nifty little [temperature sensor](https://github.com/Dahlia-Dry/ScienceOlympiad2019) that fits in an altoids tin. Look at how nice that arduino is tucked in there! Artful I dare say; and accurate! The little graph updates every 5 seconds or something like that so you can see the time trace spike when you stick the probe in different water and the LED turns red, green, or blue to indicate the temperature range. It blew away the competition and won first place in the event, with style points to boot ;)
