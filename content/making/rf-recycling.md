For our final project in the Spring 2023 term of 6.2300 Electromagnetics Waves and Applications, my group made a neat little contraption that can tell the difference between plastics and metals by measuring their dielectric permittivity. It also has a nice little motor mechanism to physically sort the material under test into a metal bin or a plastic bin, demonstrating a basic proof of concept for use of this technique to automate trash sorting - see the videos below for a demo!
